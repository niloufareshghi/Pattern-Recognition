Following previous problem, here we are going to evaluate K-NN classification capabilities in a
different area. Imagine an Image Segmentation task where the goal is to detect and separate road
regions of an input image. Such a system is necessary in many traffic-related applications, including
lane departure warning system.

Here, two frames of a rural highway are available, Figure 6 part a and b. You are given a ground truth segmented version of frame a, which can somehow be used in the training phase of a
K-NN model.

a. Use 1-NN, 5-NN and 9-NN models to apply image segmentation on the image of the frame b. Display and compare the obtained results.
